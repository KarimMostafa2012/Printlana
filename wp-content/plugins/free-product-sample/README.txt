== Ways to Offer Sample Products to Your Customers ==

= Use comprehensive strategies and ideas to reach your target audience =

With the rise of online websites and stores that sell goods, giving out sample products to customers can set your eCommerce store apart from your competition. However, you require a strategy to ensure that your samples reach the target customers and establish loyalty.
Here are a few ways in which eCommerce stores are using sample products:

<ul>
<li>Show a sneak peek to the customers into your broad range of offerings with easily consumable and impressive samples</li>
<li>Launch new and riskier products to a new audience in the market and gauge the reaction of customers by launching free samples</li>
<li>Get easy feedback and product reviews from customers regarding your products by giving them samples</li>
<li>Accurately interpret the wants and needs of customers by tracking which samples are ordered the most</li>
<li>Establish your brand as customer-centric by giving out samples of products that are popular in your store</li>
<li>Conduct sample product giveaways and offers for recurring customers, and upsell the real product in their next order</li>
<li>Create a loyal consumer base by offering free products on a timely basis</li>
<li>Offer samples on bulk orders to ensure the customer comes back again</li>
<li>Encourage customers to place larger orders by offering sample WooCommerce products after the cart exceeds a certain amount</li>
<li>Offer samples for high-end products, and encourage customers to try out the more expensive products in your store</li>
</ul>

== Product Sampling Campaign ==

= A 4-step process to design and launch an effective product sampling campaign for your WooCommerce store =

<strong>Set Realistic Goals</strong>
Establish realistic goals and objectives for your campaign

<strong>Select Your Target Audience</strong>
Select a target audience and type of key consumers towards whom you want to direct your campaign marketing

<strong>Decide the Right Time for Campaign Launch</strong>
Set a period for your campaign, i.e., close to festivals, holidays etc.

<strong>Provide Post-launch Updates to Customers</strong>
Follow up on the experience with post-purchase updates after sending out samples

== Increase Customer Loyalty == 

= Encourage your customers to become recurring buyers =

Customers directly affect your brand's performance and its ability to do well. Therefore, they need to interact with your product before spending money on it. 

Several brands miss out on potential customers by not opening up their products. As a brand, you cannot expect your audience to take your word and order the expensive products you are offering.

Product samples for your WooCommerce store can be just what you need as they can be a perfect segue to building a loyal consumer base. Customers can try your products at minimum to no cost and choose ones that fit their requirements. 

You can offer personalized recommendations to improve consumer confidence and increase the chances of getting recurring, long-term buyers for your WooCommerce store.
